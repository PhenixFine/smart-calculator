# smart_calculator
Stage 3 of 8 for JetBrains Academy Kotlin [Smart Calculator project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/88/stages/488/implement). Loops adding of numerous given numbers from the user and prints the sum. It does nothing if user sends an empty line, prints the number if user only sends one number, exits if the user types "/exit" and if the user types "/help" it prints information about what the program currently does. :smiley:
