# smart_calculator
Stage 7 of 8 for JetBrains Academy Kotlin [Smart Calculator project](https://hyperskill.org/projects/88/stages/492/implement). 
The program was adjusted from the previous stage to allow exponents, multiplication, and division, in addition to subtraction and addition. The operation of numbers can also be prioritized with parenthesis. For a stack I used Java's Stack, instead of their MutableList suggestion ( I did use a MutableList for storing numbers, and operators popped from the stack - which is then converted to an array when passed back to the calling object ).
